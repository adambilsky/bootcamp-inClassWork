      What is dead may never die. House Tarly of Horn Hill A Lannister always pays his debts. I would like a trial by combat. May the Father judge him justly. A forked purple lightning bolt, on black field speckled with four-pointed stars.

    <p2>May the Father judge him justly. A Lannister always pays his debts. May the Father judge him justly. Hear me roar! I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come. It's ten thousand miles between Kings landing and the wall. I would like a trial by combat. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.</p2><br><br>
