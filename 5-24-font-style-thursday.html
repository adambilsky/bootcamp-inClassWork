      What is dead may never die. House Tarly of Horn Hill A Lannister always pays his debts. I would like a trial by combat. May the Father judge him justly. A forked purple lightning bolt, on black field speckled with four-pointed stars. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward. A dance of dragons. The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons. A storm of swords. Words are like wind.

    <h2 id="NW2">Nightswatch 2:</h2>
    <p2>May the Father judge him justly.  I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come. More pigeon pie, please. I would like a trial by combat. The North remembers. May the Father judge him justly. Pay the iron price. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward. The battle of the redgrass field. A feast for crows. A Lannister always pays his debts. May the Father judge him justly. Hear me roar! I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come. It's ten thousand miles between Kings landing and the wall. I would like a trial by combat. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.</p2><br><br>
